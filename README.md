## Welcome to the LSPDFR Developers Knowledge Base!

Luke, why does this page and repository exist? That's simple. The LSPDFR developers discord server, along with all of discord servers, has lots of useful code snippets posted in it which you cannot access unless you are a member of the server. and even then they can be difficult to find exactly what you want without searching multiple different things.

This page is designed to allow users to find snippets by their title and hopefully allow new developers to create better plugins from it

## Changelog
*Currently no changes due to initial build of the page, check back often for updates*
