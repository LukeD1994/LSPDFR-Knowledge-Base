## Welcome to the LSPDFR Developers Knowledge Base!

Luke, why does this page and repository exist? That's simple. The LSPDFR developers discord server, along with all of discord servers, has lots of useful code snippets posted in it which you cannot access unless you are a member of the server. and even then they can be difficult to find exactly what you want without searching multiple different things.

This page is designed to allow users to find snippets by their title and hopefully allow new developers to create better plugins from it

## Changelog
*Currently no changes due to initial build of the page, check back often for updates*

## Important Notice
All of the code that can be found in this knowledge base is provided free to use, however every developer who has contributed their knowledge over the years of LSPDFR's development has taken their own personal time to write this code.
If you use any snippets, please be respectful to the developers who wrote it for you and credit them.

## Useful Links
PNWParksFan has a list of snippets already created, (check out his stuff here)[https://bitbucket.org/snippets/%7B474c531a-2a89-4c5a-8c35-7a1e648453c6%7D/]

## LSPDFR Developers Discord
We have a dedicated discord for LSPDFR developers to communite and share good coding practices, I would highly recommend joining!
*This discord server currently is not accepting new members and as such the link has not been posted, if you find an old invite link it will not stop you joining, however be aware you may not be verified as a developer and wont be able to chat with us. This is due to it being revamped and a new bot developed for it. I will repost a link when complete.
